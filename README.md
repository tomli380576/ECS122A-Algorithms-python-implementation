# ECS 122A Algorithms: Python Implementation

My implementations of all the fundamental algorithms covered in ECS122A

They are referenced in this [**Notion Document**](https://zhongning-tommy-li.notion.site/Algorithms-122AB-baebf66e9a614361aa02360592be8e0b)

Note that some of the graph algorithms references graphs in the **`example_unweighted_graphs.py`** file. Make sure the algorithm file and the graph file are in the same directory

Some algorithms now have helper functions to generate random test inputs. Make sure the **`random_inputs.py`** is  in ths same directory as the algorithm file.

## Running the code

```bash
cd ./Implementations
python3 <the file you want to run>
```

## System Requirements

Python 3.8+, Numpy
